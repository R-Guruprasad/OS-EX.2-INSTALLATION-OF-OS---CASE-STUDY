# INSTALLATION OF OS

# AIM:
To write the procedure for installation of Kali linux using virtualbox.

# MATERIALS REQUIRED:
Kali Linux .iso images, virtual box.

# PROCEDURE:

## Step 1: Download Kali Linux ISO Image

On the official Kali Linux website downloads section, you can find Kali Linux .iso images.Navigate to the Kali Linux Downloads page and find the packages available for download. Depending on the system you have, download the 64-Bit or 32-Bit version.

## Step 2: Create Kali Linux VirtualBox Container After downloading the .iso image, create a new virtual machine and import Kali as its OS.

1. Launch VirtualBox Manager and click the New icon.
2. Name and operating system. A pop-up window for creating a new VM appears. Specify a name and a destination folder. The Type and Version change automatically, based on the name you provide. Make sure the formation matches the package you downloaded and click Next.

4. Memory size. Choose how much memory to allocate to the virtual machine and click Next. The default setting for Linux is 1024 MB. However, this varies depending on your individual needs.
5. Hard disk. The default option is to create a virtual hard disk for the new VM. Click Create to continue. Alternatively, you can use an existing virtual hard disk file or decide not to add one at all.

7. Hard disk file type. Stick to the default file type for the new virtual hard disk, VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image). Click Next to continue.
8. Storage on a physical hard disk. Decide between Dynamically allocated and Fixed size. The first choice allows the new hard disk to grow and fill up space dedicated to it. The second, fixed size, uses the 
maximum capacity from the start. Click Next.
9. File location and size. Specify the name and where you want to store the virtual hard disk. Choose the amount of file data the VM is allowed to store on the hard disk. We advise giving it at least 8 Gigabytes. Click Create to finish.Now you created a new VM. The VM appears on the list in the VirtualBox Manager.

## Step 3: Installing and Setting Up Kali Linux

After you booted the installation menu by clicking Start, a new VM VirtualBox window appears with the Kali welcome screen.Select the Graphical install option and go through the following,installation steps for setting up Kali Linux in VirtualBox.

1. Select a language. Choose the default language for the system (which will also be the language used during the installation process).
2. Select your location. Find and select your country from the list (or choose “other”).
3. Configure the keyboard. Decide which keymap to use. In most cases, the best option is to select American English.
4. Configure the network. First, enter a hostname for the system and click Continue.
5. Next, create a domain name (the part of your internet address after 
your hostname). Domain names usually end in .com, .net, .edu, etc. Make sure you use the same domain name on all your machines.
6. Set up users and passwords. Create a strong root password for the system administrator account.

# RESULT 
Hence the OS is successfuly installed and set up using virtual box.
